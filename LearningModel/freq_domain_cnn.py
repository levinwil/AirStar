    Convolutional Neural Network Classifier
    Parameters
    ____________
    window : int
        The length of the window you consider for the FFT
        (MUST BE A PERFECT SQUARE)
        Generally, if you are going to do short bursts of muscle contraction,
        the window should be between 25 & 49
    Attributes
    ____________
    model : keras model
        The model after fitting

    fit
    fits the CNN to the input data and labels. Optimizes using gradient descent,
    and then evaluates how it did on a subset of your data.
    Parameters
    ---------
    X : 2d-array
        the data, where X[i] MUST BE a 1d array of size window
    labels  : 1d-array
        the labels
    numClasses : int
        the number of classes you'd like to predict
    test_size : Double
        the proportion of data you want to set aside for testing
        (MUST BE BETWEEN 0 and 1)
    batch_size : int
        the size of the batches used for gradient descent optimization
    epochs : int
        the number of iterations in which the model evaluates a batch to
        optimize
