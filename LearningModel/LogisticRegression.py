'''
A basic logistic regression model classifier that will report precision, recall, and F1 score
on 25 percent of the data.

Inputs
data: a 2d array, where x is time and y is value
labels: a 2d array, where x is time and y is the label
label_value: the value you assigned to your labels
n_estimators: the number of trees in the logistic regression model
n_jobs: the number of cores you want to use in parallel
test_size: the proportion of the data you want to use for verification (precision, recall, F1)

Outputs
lr: the fitted logistic regression model

NOTE: if you get some freaky, error, it's probably in n_jobs. If n_jobs = -1,
the logistic regression model classifier trains itself in parallel using all its cores,
which sometimes gives you some pretty freaky errors. So, just set n_jobs = 1.
