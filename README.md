# Motion-Tracking

## Goals
The following goals are very rough and subject to change:  
**Current Goal** - train a model to classify movement of the hand and arm for any application you could possibly think of  
**Long-Term Goal** - train a model to classify full-body movement  
**Alternate Goal** - train an EEG-fed model to detect bipolar episodes and/or sentiment/emotion   

## Dependencies
numpy  
scipy  
sklearn  
tensorflow  
keras  
obspy


## Folders
**Jupyter_MDs** - details about all of our algorithms and clarification as to how they can be run through examples  
**LearningModel** - the machine learning models we are using to classify signals   
**Pre-Processing** - several scripts used to "clean up" the data and prepare it for our learning model
