peakReject

runs peak rejection across every channel in the input data. When a point is
considered a peak (in the global sense), we try to bring it closer to the mean
of the 'window' points to its left

Parameters
____________

data : 2d array
    the data you want to peak rejection
z_cutoff : Double
    the z-score required for a point to be considered a peak
divide_factor : Int or Double
    when a data point is considered a peak, we find the distance that point is
    away from the local mean (will be explained in the next parameter), then
    multiply that distance by divide_factor, then add that back to the local
    mean
window : int
    the number of points to consider when bringing the peak closer to the local
    mean

Returns
____________
data : 2d array
    the peak rejected data

'''
normalize

centers the input data about the x axis so the average is 0. NOTE: we do NOT
divide by the standard deviation

Parameters
____________

data : 2d array
    the data you want to be normalized

Returns
____________
data : 2d array
    the normalized data

'''
highPass

applies a high pass filter to the input data

Parameters
____________

data : 2d array
    the data you want to be filtered
order : Int
    the order of the high pass filter
frequency : Double (0 to 1)
    the critical frequency. Is normalized between 0 and 1, where 1 is the
    Nyquist frequency (and thus will pass the original signal) and 0 will pass
    no signal

Returns
____________
data : 2d array
    the normalized data

'''
lowPass

applies a low pass filter to the input data

Parameters
____________

data : 2d array
    the data you want to be filtered
order : Int
    the order of the high pass filter
frequency : Double (0 to 1)
    the critical frequency. Is normalized between 0 and 1, where 1 is the
    Nyquist frequency (and thus will pass the original signal) and 0 will pass
    no signal

'''
bandStop

applies a band stop filter between freqmin and freqmax Hz

Parameters
____________

data : 2d array
    the data you want to be filtered
freqmin : Int (in Hz)
    the min frequency in the band stop filter
freqmax : Int (in Hz)
    the max frequency in the band stop filter

Returns
____________
data : 2d array
    the filtered data
