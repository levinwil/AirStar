"""
FFT

applies the fourier transform to every index of the input array, viewing 'window' number
of indices behind it as the input to the Fourier Transform

Parameters
---------
array-like data    --- Either an np.ndarray containing the data (MUST BE 2D, where first dimension is channel, second is time)
Integer window     --- the window size viewed behind each index as input to the Fourier Transform

Return
------
a 3D numpy array, where the first dimension is channel, the second is time, and the third is frequency

'''
highPass

applies a high pass filter to the input data

Parameters
____________

data : 3d array
    the data you want to be filtered
order : Int
    the order of the high pass filter
critical_freq : Double (0 to 1)
    the critical frequency. Is normalized between 0 and 1, where 1 is the
    Nyquist frequency (and thus will pass the original signal) and 0 will pass
    no signal

Returns
____________
data : 3d array
    the normalized data

'''
lowPass

applies a low pass filter to the input data

Parameters
____________

data : 3d array

order : Int
    the order of the high pass filter
critical_freq : Double (0 to 1)
    the critical frequency. Is normalized between 0 and 1, where 1 is the

'''
bandStop

applies a band stop filter between freqmin and freqmax Hz

Parameters
____________

data : 3d array
    the data you want to be filtered
freqmin : Int (in Hz)
    the min frequency in the band stop filter
freqmax : Int (in Hz)
    the max frequency in the band stop filter

Returns
____________
data : 3d array
    the filtered data
